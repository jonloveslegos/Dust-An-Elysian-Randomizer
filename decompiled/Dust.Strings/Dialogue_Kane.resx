    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Thank you, Dust. You must stop General Gaius, no matter what the cost.</value>
  </data>

    <value>Cora... Cora, is that you?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hold, Dust! His state has calmed! The rage that consumed him has been driven back into the darkness.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Oh, Cora... I have done such terrible things. I betrayed my friends, turned them over to General Gaius for money and power. My life... this mansion... everything I've ever owned was bought with the blood of those I loved.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, Kane! Yes it's me! Is it done? Have you come back to us?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I am so sorry, Cora. I should have trusted you. I should have told you. I just... thought you would abandon me. I thought the one good thing I ever had would leave me to die alone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's okay my love. I know... I know everything. That is why I left you. But I have come to help you set things right once again.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And you, robed one... you helped drive that demonic presence away. I owe you a debt of thanks that I fear can never be truly repaid.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm here now, my love. And I will never leave you again.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, that's easy... simply go where there are Moonbloods. Their last remaining encampment is hidden far to the north. If General Gaius knew where it was, he would personally lead the charge to wipe it off the map.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Actually, you can repay that debt right now. You worked with General Gaius, and I aim to drive him from these lands. I was told you may know something that could help me find him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_230" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That's alright, dearie. I've not the strength to return home, and I would rather spend my final hours catching up with my dear husband by my side.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_220" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You're right, but we can't just leave Cora here.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_210" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I... soon, Dust. Very soon, all of this will be explained. Come, we can discuss this later. We must hurry if we are to find Ginger and learn the location of this Moonblood camp.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_200" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ahrah? What does he mean?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_270" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Dust, reality check. Did we just exorcise a demon from beyond the pale?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_260" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then farewell, my friends. Good luck to the two of you. In this life... and the next.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_250" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thanks seem a paltry thing to offer in return for the deeds you have done here today... but they are all I have to give. I do hope you are able to find your friend in time, and that General Gaius is made to pay for his crimes against this world.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_240" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I cannot thank you enough, Dust. You've done more for us than I could possibly have asked for. I knew there was something special about you the moment I laid eyes on you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_280" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That we did. Hopefully the two of them finally find some semblance of peace. Anyway, let's get moving. We've got a lot of ground to cover.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_110" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nobody does except for the Moonbloods and... but no, that's impossible.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_130" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There was a village of Moonblood sympathizers in the mountains. I revealed their location to General Gaius. Everyone was supposed to be killed, but before I died, I remember hearing that a survivor had escaped to Aurora.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_100" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do you know where this hidden camp is?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_150" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm afraid that's all I know. If you can find this Ginger, perhaps you will find your Moonbloods. From there, you only need wait for the General to find you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_120" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What? WHAT!?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_170" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The work of the demon that imprisoned me, no doubt. With your twin souls, it likely did not want you to leave this valley before it could devour you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_140" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ginger! You're talking about Ginger!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_190" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You did not know? You possess a rare gift - two souls, joined as one. Never have I seen it before.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_160" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then we'd better hurry, Dust. Ginger's already got a head start on us. But what about that barrier?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="390_180" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Twin souls? What are you talking about?</value>
